# Solutions for Advent of Code 2025 in C#

## Why C#?

C# is incredibly cross-platform and used in game engines like Unity and Godot. I figured learning C# might make it easier for me to get back into game development than Unreal/C++ that my previous job used.

## Setup (VSCode)

- [Install .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/)
- Install the C# Extension in Visual Studio Code
  - If VSCode can't find the right executables, restart VSCode to reload env vars
